== Using an AMQ broker on OpenShift remotely

Create the project `{user-username}-fuse`. The images examples are using `evals02`, but *you must* use `{user-username}`.

. Go to the link:{openshift-host}/console[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"]
. Click on create project button & enter `{user-username}-fuse` as the project name, then click *Create*

. Select the project to enter it

. In the *Search Catalog* box at the top, search for *AMQ Broker 7.4* & select the *Red Hat AMQ Broker 7.4 (Ephemeral, no SSL)* option
+

. Fill the fields *AMQ Username* & *AMQ Password* with the value *redhat*, then click *Create* at the bottom of the screen, then *Create* again at the binding screen

. If your project was provisioned correctly, you would see a screen like this:

Now that the broker is deployed on OpenShift, we can use a mechanism that enables us to open a connection with OpenShift. This will enable us to consume services deployed on OpenShift from our local machine/CodeReady workspace. This is useful for resources like databases & message brokers.

Login to OpenShift on the terminal, choose our `{user-username}-fuse` project, & list the pods. *NOTE: The actual name of the pods that show up will be different than what is shown here.*

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
oc login {openshift-url} -u {user-username} -p {user-password}
oc project {user-username}-fuse
oc get pods

NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
broker-amq-1-ck9mc   1/1       Running   0          6m
----

Now you have the exact name of the pod running AMQ Broker. Let's execute the port-forward command. This will forward port `61616` (the port the broker listens on) to the local machine at the same port. *Make sure you use the name from the output of your command, not the name shown here!*

[source,bash]
----
    oc port-forward broker-amq-1-ck9mc 61616:61616
----

The output should look like this:

Now, update your `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to use the local broker (which is just forwarded to the actual broker running on OpenShift) instead of the embedded one. Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and uncomment the line below:

[source, bash]
----

# PORT-FORWARD BROKER
activemq.broker.url=tcp://localhost:61616

----

And comment out this line:

[source, bash]
----

# EMBEDDED BROKER
# activemq.broker.url=vm://localhost

----

Run your integration again, creating an order using the `/order/async` HTTP POST method.

Click on the AMQ console URL:

Choose the *Management Console* option:

Use `redhat` as the username & password

{empty} +

On the *Artemis* item on horizontal Menu, select *Addresses*

{empty} +

Now that you see the message metrics. Create many (like 10) new orders, using the `/order/async` HTTP POST method.

Look to the metrics again, you should se some messages on the Message Count column.
