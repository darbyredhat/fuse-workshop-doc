= Lab 0 - Workshop Introduction

Workshop structure and environment set up.

Welcome to the Fuse workshop! It's a pleasure to guide you on this hands-on experience.

This workshop aims to offer you practical experience with Red Hat Fuse. It is not meant to be a complete training of Red Hat Fuse. For this purpose we have an amazing https://www.redhat.com/pt-br/services/training/jb421-red-hat-jboss-fuse-camel-development[official training], covering many aspects of Red Hat Fuse in depth.

The main objective is to cover as many Fuse aspects during this workshop. We will be using a https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git[project skeleton] during this lab.

This *fuse-workshop* project is a Red Hat Fuse (aka https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel]) Spring Boot project, with some code already written for you. It will help you focus on what really matters rather than having you write lots of boilerplate code.

== Setup Code Ready Workspace

These walkthrough use CodeReady Workspaces (based on https://www.eclipse.org/che[Eclipse Che]).
It's an IDE on the cloud based on containers. You can also use a local development environment if you'd prefer (i.e. https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code], https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-studio/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Studio] (formerly known as JBoss Developer Studio), https://www.jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA], etc).

To build the project in your own environment, you will need:

* JDK 7+
* Maven 3+
* Git

If you already have all installed, just clone the git repository and run `mvn install`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/hodrigohamalho/fuse-workshop.git
cd fuse-workshop
mvn spring-boot:run
----

The *fuse-workshop* project is a Camel Spring Boot project, with some code already written for you. It will help you focus on what really matters rather than having you write lots of boilerplate code.

Are you seeing a loop hello message in the logs?

During the workshop you will do several changes in the source code, so to redeploy

== Summary

Congratulations you finished the setup of your environment!

In this lab, you learned how to set up a Fuse on Spring Boot project using CodeReady Workspaces.
