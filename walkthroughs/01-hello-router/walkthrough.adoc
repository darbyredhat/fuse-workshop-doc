= Lab 1 - Hello World Camel

Write your first Red Hat Fuse integration route.

Let's explore a simple scenario where we are going to use a timer component to generate Orders automatically.

== Timer component  

Using the project *fuse-workshop*, open the class *OrderGenerator.java*. 
If you are having trouble to find it, look in *src/main/java/com/redhat/fuse/booster/rest/routers/lab01* folder.

As you can see, this class is a very simple Camel Router already defined for you. A Camel Router is basically a class that extends RouteBuilder and implements the configure method.  
Let's focus on the code that really matters at the moment.

[source,java]
----
from("timer:generateOrder")
    .log("Hello router!");
----    

This code is using the timer component, with all default configurations, it will be executed in a forever the message *Hello router!"* in the console in a specific frequency.


Components are the key of Camel. They are flexible and reusable "libraries" that abstract complex operations making it trivial, boosting the developer productivity!

https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/readme.adoc[Take a look in camel components]


Now, let's use some parameters with timer component to repeat *only 5 times* within the *interval of 1 sec*. 

[source,java]
----
from("timer:generateOrder?repeatCount=5&period=1000")
    .log("Hello router!"); 
----

Use *CTLR* + *SPACE* to use the auto complete feature:

{empty} +

image::./images/camel-structure.png[]

This is the basis of component usage. The component (some examples: *file, ftp, http*), after we have the component 
name (chosen by you) and for last the parameters supported by the documentation. 

If you configured your IDE correctly, you should have autocomplete working for it. 

Now, let's run the project clicking on the *RUN* or *RE-RUN* action that we previously set up and see if it works.

If you are doing it locally, you can run as a standard spring-boot application.

    mvn spring-boot:run

Do you see 5 *Hello router!* messages on the console?

Think in camel as a pipeline, that transport things *from* someplace to *another one*, and this message is in the body. 

Camel’s syntax is inspired by the UNIX pipeline.

In UNIX, we might execute something like `ps -fe | grep foo`. 
When we run this command, the output of the ps command becomes the input to the grep command. 
We “pipe” the output of one command into the input of another command.

Camel chains these actions together in an object called an Exchange, which consists of an input message (called the “In” message), some sort of processor (like a component, for instance) and possibly an output or “Out” message if the processor is meant to provide a synchronous response.

A series of Exchange state changes creates a Camel Route.

Take a look in the log that accesses the item attribute inside the Order object, and the Order is the body itself.

Take some time and take a look at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/apache_camel_development_guide/basicprinciples[this documentation] to understand better how the camel pipeline works.

== Generating Orders Automatically 

Now, take a look in the class *OrderService.java*, it generates an *Order.java* object, alternating some values between *Camel* and *ActiveMQ*.

Let's call this method to get a new Order using the *bean* method. 

[source,java]
----
from("timer:generate?repeatCount=5&period=1000")
    .log("Generating Order...")
    .bean(OrderService.class, "generateOrder")
    .log("Order ${body.item} generated");
----

Now, it is using the OrderService class to generate a new Order, print some information in the console.

And... Where is the Order object? 

If your answer was in the body, you are right! 

[type=verification]
Do you see different Orders by the messages on the console?

== Summary 

Congratulations you finished the Hello Router lab! 

On this lab, you learned about the camel pipelines and how it works. 
Also to interact with Jave Beans directly from your DSL.
